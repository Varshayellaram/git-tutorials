git is a famous version control system 

    vcs is used to store , maintain and track the code changes of a project
github is a remote repository hosting service  -- this github stores all the repositories in it
repository -- it is folder or a project

there are 4 main stages in git--
      1.remote repo
      2.local repo
      3.staging area
      4.working directory


companies uses - bitbucket vcs for their applications
for beginners git is used
git is free any one can create the account and maintain the code
 
a repository can consits of any type of files like txt,py,java,img 
no commits --means no errors

when we create a file and we check for the status then it tells that untracked file 
that is called  we are stored the file in working directory

without staging area we cannot send the files individually which we need only we able to send all the files which are present in working 
  directory at a time.
we can send any no of files we need into the staging area from working directory

--staging area  == changes to be commited 
--working directory == untracked files

--we cannot see the local repo,remote repo files

local repository -- the project folder which we created in our system is called local repo
remote repository -- the project folder which we not created in our sytem is called remote repo

in github gitignore -- is a folder which allows us to specify any files which should be ignored while commiting or pushing a file


COMMANDS 
git init -- used to initialise a project or a folder
git --version  .. to heck the version of git
git status  -- used to see the status of the git repo
git add <file_name with extension>  -- is used to send files into staging area
git commit --used to commit the files into local repo
git commit -m "commiting code file"  --this is used to commit the file by passing some message

after commiting into local repo we need to create a remote repo to puch to it so we have to create a repo in github 
after that we get the line as add remote and followed with a repo
copy that and paste it in cmd
after running then we can push into remote repo
otherwise we cannot directly push into remote repo


using 'commit' command we can send files into local repo
using 'push' command we can send files from local repo to remote repo
